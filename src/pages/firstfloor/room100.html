            <h1>Embrace your humility</h1>
            <h4>As you and Virgil work your way through moving rocks, you are haunted by the spirits of those who suffered from pride, the first of the Seven Deadly Sins.</h4>
            <h4>Without them speaking, your voices echo through your head. You slowly feel as if you are losing control over your emotions. Your sense of self starts to grow tenfold.</h4>
            <h4>You begin grinning as you remember all the times in your life when you were superior to others, when you acted on your pride alone, when you've stepped on your commrades for your own gain.</h4>
            <h4>Your body feels so light, so light you feel like flying. It feels as wings have grown on your back.</h4>
            <h4>As Virgil grabs quickly onto a rock that he places on his back, and begins chanting a prayer.</h4>
