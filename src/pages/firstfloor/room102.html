            <h3>THE PROUD</h3>
            <h3>LUCIFER'S TEMPLE</h3>
            <h1>Repent all your bad love</h1>
            <h4>You have reached a room full of illustrations of Lucifer, the prideful fallen angel.</h4>
            <h4>The statue of the ruler of Hell has three faces: one looking forward is bright red, that on the right a dirty yellow, and on the left black. Behind each face is a pair of vane-like wings which are fanning the ice-cold wind blowing across Lake
                Cocytus. His six eyes are weeping, and each mouth is chewing one of the souls from that pit of Hell. Virgil points out that one of them, whose legs protrude from Luciferâ€™s lips, is Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ for thirty pieces
                of silver. The other two are Brutus and Cassius, being punished for their assassination of Julius Caesar.</h4>
            <h4>An angel guards the statue of the embodiment of Pride, Envy, and Wrath.</h4>
            <h4>He looks at you and asks if you are ready to repent. He tells you only those who have understood what bad love is, and are ready to repent it, can move up the Purgatory.</h4>
            <h4>He awaits your answer.</h4>
